1. Agent: The entity or system that makes decisions and takes actions within an environment.

2. Environment: The external system or surroundings with which the agent interacts. The environment provides feedback to the agent based on its actions.

3. State: A representation of the current situation or configuration of the environment.

4. Action: The set of possible moves or decisions that the agent can make.

5. Reward: A numerical signal that the environment provides to the agent, indicating the immediate benefit or cost associated with the action taken.

The agent's objective is to learn a policy, which is a mapping from states to actions, in such a way that it can maximize the expected cumulative reward over time. Reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to various tasks, including game playing, robotic control, and autonomous systems.

Popular algorithms used in reinforcement learning include Q-Learning, Deep Q Networks (DQN), Policy Gradient methods, and more recently, algorithms based on deep neural networks, such as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
